### Amortizing and Accreting Cap and Floor

An amortizing cap is primarily used to hedge loans whose principal declines on a scheduled basis while an accreting cap is primarily used to hedge construction loans 
whose principal increases on a scheduled basis to meet the expanding working capital requirements. Amortizing caps are frequently purchased by issuers of floating 
rate debt where the loan principal declines during the life. Similarly accreting caps are frequently purchased by issuers of floating rate debt where the loan principal 
increases during the life. The holders wish to protect themselves from the increased financing costs that would result from a rise in interest rates.

### Amortizing and Accreting Swap  

The notional principal of an amortizing swap is tied to an underlying financial instrument with a declining principal, such as a mortgage. On the other hand, 
the notional amount of an accreting swap  is tied to an underlying instrument with an increasing principal, such as a construction fund. The notional principal 
schedule of an amortizing or an accreting swap may decrease or increase at the same rate as the underlying instrument. Both amortizing and accreting swaps can be 
used to reduce or increase exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.

 ### Basis Swap 
 
 A basis swap can be used to limit interest rate risk that a firm faces as a result of having different lending and borrowing rates. Basis swaps help investors 
 to mitigate basis risk that is a type of risk associated with imperfect hedging. Firms also utilize basis swaps to hedge the divergence of different rates. Basis 
 swaps could involve many different kinds of reference rates for the floating payments, such as 3-month LIBOR, 1-month LIBOR, 6-month LIBOR, prime rate, etc. There 
 is an active market for basis swaps.

  ### Interest Rate Bermudan Swaption
  
 Given those flexibilities, a Bermudan swaption is more expensive than a regular European swaption. In terms of valuation, it is also much more complex.

   ### Interest Rate Cancelable Swap 
   
  A cancelable swap provides the right but not the obligation to cancel the interest rate swap at predefined dates. Most commonly traded cancelable swaps have 
  multiple exercise dates. Given its Bermudan style optionality, a cancelable swap can be represented as a vanilla swap embedded with a Bermudan swaption. 
  Therefore, it can be decomposed into a swap and a Bermudan swaption. Most Bermudan swaptions in a bank book actually come from cancelable swaps.

   ### Interest Rate Caps and Floors 
   
   An interest rate cap is a financial contract between two parties that provides an interest rate ceiling or cap on the floating rate payments. It actually 
   consists of a series of European call options (caplets) on interest rates.  The buyer receives payments at the end of each period when the interest rate 
   exceeds the strike.  In return, the buyer needs to pay an up-front premium to the seller.
