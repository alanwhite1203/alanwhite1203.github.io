### Amortizing and Accreting Cap and Floor



An amortizing cap or floor is a special type of interest rate cap or floor whose notionals decrease at predefined dates, while an accreting cap is also a special type of interest rate cap or floor whose notionals increase
at predefined date. Amortizing/accreting cap or floor is very useful for hedging variable principal loans where the principal of a loan is changing dur the life of the contract.

### Basis Swap 
 
Unlike a regular interest rate swap, an interest rate basis swap has two floating legs. Each leg is derived from different index rates. Basis swaps are settled periodically and are quoted as a spread over the reference index. 

A basis swap can be used to limit interest rate risk that a firm exposes as a result of having different lending and borrowing rates. Basis swaps help investors to mitigate basis risk. Firms also utilize basis swaps to hedge 
the divergence of different rates.

### Interest Rate Bermudan Swaption
  
An interest rate Bermudan swaption gives the holder the right but not the obligation to enter an interest rate swap at predefined dates. It is one of the fundamental ways for an investor to enter a swap. Comparing to regular 
swaptions, Bermudan swaptions provide market participants more flexibility and control over the exercising of an option and less restriction.

### Interest Rate Cancelable Swap 
   

A cancelable swap provides the holder the right but not the obligation to cancel the interest rate swap at predefined dates. Cancelable swaps have multiple exercise dates. That means it has Bermudan style optionality. In other
words, a cancelable swap is a vanilla swap embedded with a Bermudan swaption.

### Capped Swap
   
A capped or floored swap is an interest rate swap embedded with an interest rate cap or floor option where the floating rate of the swap is capped or floo at a certain level. Capped swaps or floored swaps limit the risk of 
the floating rate payer or receiver to adverse movements in interest rates. A capped or floored swap can be decomposed into a swap and a cap or floor.

### Compounding Swap
   
A compounding swap is an interest rate swap in which interest is not paid immediately, instead it is compounded forward into the next payment date. Compounding swaps can be valued by assuming that the forward rates are realized.
 
Normally the calculation period of a compounding swap is smaller than the payment period. For example, an overnight index swap has 12-month payment period and daily calculation period.

### Forward Rate Agreement
   
A forward rate agreement (FRA) is a forward contract between two parties in which one party will pay a fixed rate while the other party will pay a reference interest rate for a set future period. Similar to a swap, a FRA has 
two legs: a fixed leg and a floating leg. But each leg only has one cash flow. The party paying the fixed rate is usually referred to as the borrower, while the party receiving the floating rate is referred to as the lender.

### Interest Rate Futures
   
An interest rate future is a futures contract between the buyer and seller to deliver an interest bearing asset. Futures allow the buyer and seller to lock in the price of the interest bearing asset for a future date. 
The most popular interest rate future is Eurodollar future. The underlying instrument in Eurodollar futures is a Eurodollar time deposit having a principal value of $1,000,000 with a three-month maturity. Eurodollar 
futures prices are expressed numerically using 100 minus the implied 3-month U.S. dollar LIBOR interest rate.

### Future Option
   
An interest rate future option gives the holder the right but not the obligation to buy or sell an interest rate future at a specified price on a specified date. The buyer normally can exercise the option on any business day 
(American style) prior to expiration by giving notice to the exchange. Option sellers (writer) receive a fixed premium upfront and in return are obligated to buy or sell the underlying asset at a specified price.

### Interest Rate Swap 
   
An interest rate swap is a financial contract between two parties to exchange future interest rate payments over a set period of time. It consists of a series of payment periods, called swaplets. A vanilla interest rate swap
involves the exchange of a fixed interest rate for a floating rate, or vice versa. In other words, it has two legs: a fixed leg and a floating leg. Swaps are OTC derivatives that bear counterparty 
credit risk beside interest rate risk.

### Swaption
   
An interest rate swaption is a European OTC option that grants its owner the right but not the obligation to enter an underlying interest rate swap. There are two types of swaptions: a payer swaption and a receiver swaption.

An payer swaption is also called a right-to-pay swaption that allows its holder to exercise into a swap where the holder pays fixed rates and receives floating rates, while a receiver swaption is also called right-to-receive 
swaption that allows its holders to exercise into a swap where the holder receives fixed rates and pays floating rates.
