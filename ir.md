### Amortizing and Accreting Cap and Floor

An amortizing cap is primarily used to hedge loans whose principal declines on a scheduled basis while an accreting cap is primarily used to hedge construction loans 
whose principal increases on a scheduled basis to meet the expanding working capital requirements. Amortizing caps are frequently purchased by issuers of floating 
rate debt where the loan principal declines during the life. Similarly accreting caps are frequently purchased by issuers of floating rate debt where the loan principal 
increases during the life. The holders wish to protect themselves from the increased financing costs that would result from a rise in interest rates.

### Amortizing and Accreting Swap  

The notional principal of an amortizing swap is tied to an underlying financial instrument with a declining principal, such as a mortgage. On the other hand, 
the notional amount of an accreting swap  is tied to an underlying instrument with an increasing principal, such as a construction fund. The notional principal 
schedule of an amortizing or an accreting swap may decrease or increase at the same rate as the underlying instrument. Both amortizing and accreting swaps can be 
used to reduce or increase exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.

### Basis Swap 
 
 A basis swap can be used to limit interest rate risk that a firm faces as a result of having different lending and borrowing rates. Basis swaps help investors 
 to mitigate basis risk that is a type of risk associated with imperfect hedging. Firms also utilize basis swaps to hedge the divergence of different rates. Basis 
 swaps could involve many different kinds of reference rates for the floating payments, such as 3-month LIBOR, 1-month LIBOR, 6-month LIBOR, prime rate, etc. There 
 is an active market for basis swaps.

### Interest Rate Bermudan Swaption
  
 Given those flexibilities, a Bermudan swaption is more expensive than a regular European swaption. In terms of valuation, it is also much more complex.

### Interest Rate Cancelable Swap 
   
  A cancelable swap provides the right but not the obligation to cancel the interest rate swap at predefined dates. Most commonly traded cancelable swaps have 
  multiple exercise dates. Given its Bermudan style optionality, a cancelable swap can be represented as a vanilla swap embedded with a Bermudan swaption. 
  Therefore, it can be decomposed into a swap and a Bermudan swaption. Most Bermudan swaptions in a bank book actually come from cancelable swaps.

### Interest Rate Caps and Floors 
   
   An interest rate cap is a financial contract between two parties that provides an interest rate ceiling or cap on the floating rate payments. It actually 
   consists of a series of European call options (caplets) on interest rates.  The buyer receives payments at the end of each period when the interest rate 
   exceeds the strike.  In return, the buyer needs to pay an up-front premium to the seller.

### Capped Swap
   
   A capped swap can be decomposed into a swap and a cap whereas a floored swap can be decomposed into a swap and a floor. Given the optionality, an up-front 
   fee or premium has to be paid by the floating rate payer for a capped swap and an up-front fee or premium has to be paid by the floating rate receiver for 
   a floored swap.

### Compounding Swap
   
   A compounding swap is an interest rate swap in which interest, instead of being paid, compounds forward until the next payment date. Compounding swaps can be 
   valued by assuming that the forward rates are realized. Normally the calculation period of a compounding swap is smaller than the payment period. For example, 
   a swap has 6-month payment period and 1-month calculation period (or 1-month index tenor). An overnight index swap (OIS) is a typical compounding swap.

### Forward Rate Agreement
   
   A FRA can be used to hedge future interest rate or exchange rate exposure. The buyer hedges against the risk of rising interest rate whereas the seller hedges 
   against the risk of falling interest rates. In other words, the buyer locks in the interest rate to protect against the increase of interest rates while the 
   seller protects against the possible decrease of interest rates. A speculator can also use FRAs to make bets on future directional changes in interest rates. 
   Market participants can also take advantage of price differences between an FRA and other interest rate instruments. FRAs are money market instruments that are 
   liquid in all major currencies.

### Interest Rate Futures
   
   Interest rate futures are used to hedge against interest rate risk. Investors can use Eurodollar futures to secure an interest rate for money it plans to borrow 
   or lend in the future. Interest rate futures are mainly listed for 3-month Eurodollar, 1-month LIBOR, 1-month banker’s acceptance futures and 3-month banker’s 
   acceptance futures.

### Future Option
   
   Interest rate future options can be used to hedge against adverse changes in interest rates. In general futures markets tend to be more liquid than underlying 
   cash markets. This presentation gives an overview of interest rate future option product and pricing model.

### Interest Rate Swap 
   
   Interest rate swaps are the most popular OTC derivatives that are generally used to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. Swaps can be also used 
   to obtain a marginally lower interest rate. Thus they are often utilized by a firm that can borrow money easily at one type of interest rate but prefers a 
   different type. They also allow investors to adjust interest rate exposure and offset interest rate risks. Speculators use swaps to speculate on the movement 
   of interest rates. More and more swaps are cleared through central counterparties nowadays (CCPs).

### Swaption
   
   An interest rate swaption or interest rate European swaption is an OTC option that grants its owner the right but not the obligation to enter an underlying 
   interest rate swap. There are two types of swaptions: a payer swaption and a receiver swaption. A payer swaption is also called a right-to-pay swaption that 
   allows its holder to exercise into a swap where the holder pays fixed rates and receives floating rates. A receiver swaption is also called right-to-receive 
   swaption that allows its holders to exercise into a swap where the holder receives fixed rates and pays floating rates. Swaptions provide clients with a 
   guarantee that the fixed rate of interest they will pay at some of future time will not exceed certain level.
