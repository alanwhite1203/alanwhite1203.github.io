### Basis Swap 
 
Unlike a regular interest rate swap, an interest rate basis swap has two floating legs. Each leg is derived from different index rates. Basis swaps are settled periodically and are quoted as a spread over the reference index. 

A basis swap can be used to limit interest rate risk that a firm exposes as a result of having different lending and borrowing rates. Basis swaps help investors to mitigate basis risk. Firms also utilize basis swaps to hedge 
the divergence of different rates.

### Compounding Swap
   
A compounding swap is an interest rate swap in which interest is not paid immediately, instead it is compounded forward into the next payment date. Compounding swaps can be valued by assuming that the forward rates are realized.
 
Normally the calculation period of a compounding swap is smaller than the payment period. For example, an overnight index swap has 12-month payment period and daily calculation period.

### Interest Rate Swap 
   
An interest rate swap is a financial contract between two parties to exchange future interest rate payments over a set period of time. It consists of a series of payment periods, called swaplets. A vanilla interest rate swap
involves the exchange of a fixed interest rate for a floating rate, or vice versa. In other words, it has two legs: a fixed leg and a floating leg. Swaps are OTC derivatives that bear counterparty 
credit risk beside interest rate risk.

### Swaption
   
An interest rate swaption is a European OTC option that grants its owner the right but not the obligation to enter an underlying interest rate swap. There are two types of swaptions: a payer swaption and a receiver swaption.

An payer swaption is also called a right-to-pay swaption that allows its holder to exercise into a swap where the holder pays fixed rates and receives floating rates, while a receiver swaption is also called right-to-receive 
swaption that allows its holders to exercise into a swap where the holder receives fixed rates and pays floating rates.
