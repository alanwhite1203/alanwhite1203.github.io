## Violation Groups
   
As a part of the intraday Deal Entry, a Limit Check is performed against deals in the order that they entered the system. The Limit Check process will be repeatable and the previous results can be consistently 
recreated for the purpose of future investigations:

It will be possible to determine order between any two given deals. Apply system “enter” time in order to determine deal order. It doesn’t matter how order is determined, so long as it is possible to determine 
order between any 2 given deals. Being able to determine order between deals will allow for the process by which a Limit Check is performed repeatable.

A list of violations is created – each violation will be attributed to the marginal deal that caused the breach. A deal can breach a given limit only once.

It is possible that multiple violations can be created for the same breached limit – one violation for each additional deal that causes a limit breach. A single deal can breach multiple different limits, and 
so then may cause multiple violations.

Based on characteristics of the deal that the violation is attributed to, and based on attributes of the limit that was breached, a violation will be: Categorized to a particular type of violation, and
Assigned to a particular “Violation Approval Process” workflow.

Violation Groups. Every violation is attributed to a given deal, and every violation will be assigned to a given “Violation Approval Process”. After violations have been generated, they will then be grouped into 
one single violation group if both of the following are true:
a.	All violations are attributed to the same deal, and
b.	All violations have been assigned to the same “Violation Approval Process”.
