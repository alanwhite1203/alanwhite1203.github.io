## 	Functional Interface 
   
This use case involves the application of a previously defined result view on a reference data snapshot for reporting purposes.  It is similar to the View Existing Run Results however aims 
at only interacting with Reference Data rather than Run Results.
   
The system will allow for the selection reference data Views defined in UC3

The system will allow for the selection of a snapshot from which to take the reference data (i.e. EOD April 23, 2013; EOD April 20, 2013; April 5, 2013 12PM) from the full list of snapshots available to the system

The system will allow all the same pivot / filter / formatting functionality as available in UC6 - View Existing Run Results

The system will provide a list of runs currently accessible in a chronological order along with brief details of execution parameters 

The system will allow for the definition of a new run based on characteristics of an already executed run (update and re-run) or based on a new run definition
