###  FX Asian Option

An FX Asian option or Asian currency option is a special type of option contract where the payoff depends on the average of the underlying exchange rates over a certain period of time. The payoff is different from the case of a European option or American option, where the payoff of the option contract depends on the underlying FX rate at exercise date. 

Asian FX options allow the buyer to purchase or sell the underlying foreign exchange rate at the average rate instead of the spot rate. Asian options are commonly seen options over the OTC markets. Average rate options are less expensive than regular options and are arguably more appropriate than regular options for meeting some of investment needs. Average can be calculated in a number of ways (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).
