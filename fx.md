###  FX Asian Option

An FX Asian option or Asian currency option is a special type of option contract where the payoff depends on the average of the underlying exchange rates over a certain period of time. The payoff is different from the case of a European option or American option, where the payoff of the option contract depends on the underlying FX rate at exercise date. 

Asian FX options allow the buyer to purchase or sell the underlying foreign exchange rate at the average rate instead of the spot rate. Asian options are commonly seen options over the OTC markets. Average rate options are less expensive than regular options and are arguably more appropriate than regular options for meeting some of investment needs. Average can be calculated in a number of ways (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

### FX Touch Option
   
A touch option is a transaction with one or two barriers. The buyer of the option will get a cash amount either if the barrier is touch or not touched.  Touch options are becoming increasingly popular because they pay much higher yields compared to high/low options. 

A touch option is the sort of option that promises a payout once the price of an underlying asset reaches or passes a predetermined level. Touch options allow investors to choose the target price, time to expiration, and the premium to be received when the target price is reached.
