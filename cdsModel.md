## Reference Data
   

The system will allow for a user to import a new reference dataset definition.

The system will allow for a user to import (add / update / delete / overwrite) new data in a reference dataset from a file

The system will apply the changes from an import as if the user had made the changes including all audit tracking / history, validation of data etc.

The system will allow for the Import / Export of Reference Data to a desired format.  Formats available must include
- csv (with the ability to specify delimiter)
- fixed width text file
- Excel
   
The system should allow for the import / export of multiple reference datasets at once

The system must provide at least one format (preferably excel) that allows for an exported file to be imported into another instance and will regenerate the exact same of data without errors

The system should allow for the import / export of definition and data in a single action / file

Without user-defined reference datasets, the system will provide access to all the reference data as defined in the Data Model.  i.e. Address, Agreements, Geography, etc.
