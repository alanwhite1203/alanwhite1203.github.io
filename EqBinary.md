## View Existing Run Results
   
The system will allow for drilldown into any node on the pivot that has more than one result associated with it.  For example, if the data point provided is a PFE calculation, the full set of 
time bucket results and scenarios should be drillable.

The system will allow the user whether duplicated values in aggregation levels should be repeated or not.

The system will allow for any reference data being in the results view to be shown in its entirety so that even if certain members donâ€™t have data, they are still shown.

For example, a trade is always booked under a particular Legal Entity within the organizational structure.  If a new entity is added to the current list but does not have any trades, 
the user must have the ability to select that all Legal Entities are still shown in the report.

The system will allow for coloring of rows / values in the resultset based on specific constraints / parameters

The system will allow the user to filter the underlying data used in the view based on any of the fields available.
