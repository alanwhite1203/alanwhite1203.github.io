## Fixed Income Derivatives

### Amortizing Bond

An amortizing bond is used specifically for tax purposes as the amortized principal is treated as part of a company’s interest expense. An accreting bond is used 
to improve the profit of the existing bond and make it more marketable. Pension funds and insurance companies are major investors in accreting bonds.

### Fixed Rate Bond

 Fixed rate bonds generally pay higher coupons than interest rates. An investor who wants to earn a guaranteed interest rate for a specified term can choose fixed 
 rate bonds. The benefit of a fixed rate bond is that investors know for certain how much interest rate they will earn and for how long. Due to the fixed coupon, 
 the market value of a fixed rate bond is susceptible to fluctuation in interest rate and therefore has a significant interest rate risk.

### Bond Futures
 
Investors use bond futures to hedge an existing bond portfolio against adverse interest rate movements or enhance the long-term performance of the portfolio. 
Arbitrageurs profit from the price difference between the spot bonds and the bond futures. Speculators use bond futures in the hope of making a profit on 
short-term movements in prices. This presentation provides an overview of bond future product and valuation.

### Bond Future Option

Bond futures options are also exchange traded derivatives on treasury instruments. They provide market participants with the ability to adjust their interest 
rate exposures. A bond future option is also a good tool for hedging, income enhancement, duration adjustments, interest rate speculation and spread trading.

### Callable Bond

For issuers, callable bonds allow them to reduce interest costs at a future date should rate decrease. For investors, callable bonds allow them to earn a 
higher interest rate of return until the bonds are called off. If interest rates have declined since the issuer first issues the bond, the issuer is like 
to call its current bond and reissues it at a lower coupon. Callable bonds protect issuers. Therefore, a callable bond normally pays investors a higher coupon 
than a non-callable bond. This presentation gives an overview of callable bond and valuation model.

### Floating Rate Note

A floating rate note (FRN) is a bond in which the investor will receive coupons paid by the issuer at a floating coupon equivalent to a money market reference 
rate, such as LIBOR or federal fund rate plus a spread at specified dates before bond maturity.

### Inflation Linked Bond

An inflation indexed bond is designed to hedge the inflation risk of the bond. Since inflation indexed bonds offer investors a very high level of safety, 
their coupons are typically lower than high-yield bonds. It is an important vehicle for investors whose liabilities indexed to changes in inflation or wages. 
Inflation indexed bonds have favorable performance and lower volatility relative to other risk assets. It is favorable to retirement planning and pension funds 
given its inflation protection. Inflation indexed bonds are less liquid than regular bonds.

### Puttable Bond

Although a puttable bond is a higher cost to the investor and an uncertainty to the issuer comparing to a regular bond, it is actually quite attractive to both 
issuers and investors. For investors, puttable bonds allow them to reduce interest costs at a future date should rate increase. For issuers, puttable bonds allow 
them to pay a lower interest rate of return until the bonds are sold back. If interest rates have increased since the issuer first issues the bond, the investor 
is like to call its current bond and reinvest it at a higher coupon. This presentation gives an overview of puttable bond and valuation model.

### Zero Coupon Bond

Zero coupon bonds are issued at a deep discount and repaid the face value at maturity. The greater the length of the maturity is the cheaper price a bond has. 
Unlike other bonds, the investor’s return is the difference between the purchase price and the face value. An investor preferring a long-term investment may 
purchase zero coupon bonds such as saving money for children’s college tuition. The deep discount helps the investor grow a small amount of money into a sizable 
sum over several years. Normally investors buy zero coupon bonds when interest rates are high.
