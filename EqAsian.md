## Limit Breach

This document lists general workflow process requirements for the CCR project.  Specifically, it lists the workflow processes needed to adequately replace the currrent system.  It may also contain workflow process 
requirements for processes immediately surrounding or connecting to the current system so that the existing functionality can be replicated. 

The term delete shall mean: indicate as no longer active, not physically deleted.  Any deleted entity shall still be retrievable up to the retention period.

The system will allow for a user to view all reference data currently stored in the system

The system will allow for a user to add, remove, update any reference data 

The system will allow for a user to define a new set of reference data (i.e. Example: Dataset Name: Countries

When creating reference data, the user must have the option to define the datatypes for each piece of reference data 

The system will allow for the hierarchal definition of reference data (i.e. Continent  Country  State)

The system will allow for a user to perform a mass update of a piece of reference data (i.e. Change All Country data where Country is “China” to “Republic of China”)

The system will allow for filtering of reference data on any column in the reference data set

The system will allow for mass removal of selected records 

The system will keep track and make available to the user, a list of all changes to a record (i.e. January 1, 2013, Record ID CHN had Full Name China Changed to Republic of China)
