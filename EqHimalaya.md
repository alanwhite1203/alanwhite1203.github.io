General requirements regarding the system’s GUI design, steps involved in configuring the system and an overview of the user framework specification. Requirements to interacts with a portfolio; 
how portfolios can be opened, saved, viewed and edited

Manage impact analysis between runs with different results due to input changes of market data, model parameters/calibration (e.g. due to recalibration), etc… Allow the user to 1. Verify the 
application of add-on factor tables and 2. Help generate new add-on factor tables by constructing at the money trades.

The system allows a user to open several instances of the application with appropriate navigation to allow for new instances to be opened. Users are able to define a user-specific view to display
