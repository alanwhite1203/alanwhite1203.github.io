### Asian Basket Relative Performance Option 

The pay of a basket Asian relative performance option (RPO) is determined by the difference between the performance of a reference stock and that of a basket of stocks, where performance is defined as the ratio of (weighted) average of two sets of averaging dates. A model is presented for pricing basket Asian RPO using Monte Carlo simulation.

### Bet Option 

A bet option is a bet on a basket of stocks.  There are multiple reset periods before the maturity of the option.  At the end of each period, if all the stocks in the basket are above their respective strikes, the option will payout a rebate amount for this period at maturity.

### Digital Return Note

The structure of a Binary Return Note is similar to the one of a regular note, but the coupons are contingent on return rates on stocks. We developed and implemented a Monte Carlo (Quasi-Monte Carlo) pricing model for the Binary Return Note product.

### Bond Futures Option 

For bond futures options, the futures price is taken directly from the market instead of being calculated from the bond futures calculator.

### Bond Option

We present a pricing model for bond options. Assuming that the bond price at the maturity of the option is lognormal, the model adopts the Blackâ€™s analytical closed-form solution. In market, both the underlying spot price of bond and the strike price are clean prices (quoted prices), while dirty prices are used in the price dynamic and the closed-form solution.

### Callable Asian Option 

Asian options allow their underwriters to call the options back from investors at a specified time and with a specified amount prior to option maturities.  A hybrid of Monte Carlo simulation and the closed form solution is employed in pricing.
