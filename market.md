### Asian Basket Relative Performance Option 

The pay of a basket Asian relative performance option (RPO) is determined by the difference between the performance of a reference stock and that of a basket of stocks, where performance is defined as the ratio of (weighted) average of two sets of averaging dates. A model is presented for pricing basket Asian RPO using Monte Carlo simulation.

### Bet Option 

A bet option is a bet on a basket of stocks.  There are multiple reset periods before the maturity of the option.  At the end of each period, if all the stocks in the basket are above their respective strikes, the option will payout a rebate amount for this period at maturity.

### Digital Return Note

The structure of a Binary Return Note is similar to the one of a regular note, but the coupons are contingent on return rates on stocks. We developed and implemented a Monte Carlo (Quasi-Monte Carlo) pricing model for the Binary Return Note product.
