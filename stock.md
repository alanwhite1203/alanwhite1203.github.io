### GIC Pooling 

Guaranteed investment certificate provides investors a guaranteed interest rate for a fixed amount time. Interest is accrued daily on GIC. Accrued interest will be reported annually

Payoff for equity GIC requires a dynamically created basket such that the weight factors incorporate a division by the spot levels on the issue date, which converts the payoff to one based on a basket of comparative returns (rather than basket returns). To automate feeds on a daily basis we will need to create new baskets on a daily basis.

### Quanto Himalayan Option 

Himalayan options are a form of European-style, path-dependent, exotic option on a basket of equity underliers, in which intermediate returns on selected equities enter the payoff, while the
equities are subsequently removed from the basket.

This definition is consistent with the one in the case of domestic equities, that is, in the absence of a quanto adjustment. In the quanto case, the effect of the change in the quanto adjustment resulting from a change in the volatility is ignored.
