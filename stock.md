### GIC Pooling 

Guaranteed investment certificate provides investors a guaranteed interest rate for a fixed amount time. Interest is accrued daily on GIC. Accrued interest will be reported annually

Payoff for equity GIC requires a dynamically created basket such that the weight factors incorporate a division by the spot levels on the issue date, which converts the payoff to one based on a basket of comparative returns (rather than basket returns). To automate feeds on a daily basis we will need to create new baskets on a daily basis.
