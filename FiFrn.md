## Deal Entry Context

Deal entry covers both the situation where deal details are committed into production and the case where a deal is entered for the purpose of analysis only, e.g. a What-If Investigation. 

Deals that are committed into production typically enter the credit system after deal details have originally been entered into a source trading system by the executing trader. Manual deal entry is also possible in order 
to fix any potential errors. 

A pre-deal check (PDC) can be used to test for credit availability and for potential deal exceptions before committing them in the source system.

The below process includes: 1) Booked deals not utilizing a pre-deal check, and 2) Booked deals after having utilized a pre-deal check.
