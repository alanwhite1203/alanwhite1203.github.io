## Workflow Conventions
   
The term delete shall mean: indicate as no longer active, not physically deleted.  Any deleted entity shall still be retrievable up to the retention period.

A configurable set of filter rules shall mean: Filter rules shall be based on meta-data driven constructs, using SDR catalogues to define the business logic and simple comparison operators. 
1.	Examples of simple comparison operators include “>=”, “=”, “AND”, “OR”, and “IN”. 
2.	Groups. It will be possible to define groups of a set of parameters for the purposes of applying filter rules, e.g. set up a list of the usernames for all users who are in the Credit Models team.
3.	The specific functionality is defined in the DRS documents for Data requirements, however applications are described here.

Workflow Instance Attributes are a set that includes:
1.	The values in the database record for a given workflow instance, i.e. values in the respective entry in the tables WF_Step_F, and WF_Instance_F.
2.	The values in the RDR record of the Object being approved.
