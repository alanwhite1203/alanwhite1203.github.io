### Variable Rate Swap

Variable rate swap is a special type of interest rate swap in which one leg of the swap corresponds to fixed rate payments while the other involves fixed rate payments for an initial period of time and a floating rate for the rest. The floating rate on that portion is defined as a minimum of two index rates.

We treat the two index rates as assets whose values are lognormally distributed random variable. Their pricing procedure uses discount factors retrieved from the EURIBOR curve.

### CMS Spread Option 

A constant maturity swap (CMS) spread option makes payments based on a bounded spread between two index rates (e.g., a GBP CMS rate and a EURO CMS rate).  The GBP CMS rate is calculated from a 15 year swap with semi-annual, upfront payments, while the EURO CMS rate is based on a 15 year swap with annual, upfront payments. 

From the above the correlation, under foreign T-forward measure, between the Brownian motions respectively driving the foreign bond yield and GBP swap rate processes constrains the correlation between the Brownian motions driving the Euro bond yield and forward GBP CMS rate processes under domestic T-forward measure.

### Early Start Swap 

An early start swap is a swap that has an American style option for the counterparty of starting the swap early, within a period of three month. Otherwise, the swaps are plain vanilla fixed-for-floating swaps.

The present value of the swap is then calculated as the sum of present values of corresponding cash flows. To simulate the swap value at a later date, the coupon bond is represented through its forward rate of return.

### Quanto Total Return LIBOR Swap 

A quanto total return Libor Swap is a swap where one leg is a regular floating leg paying LIBOR less a constant spread and the other leg makes a single payment at the swapâ€™s maturity equal to a leveraged non-negative return on USD-for-EURO exchange rate paid in CAD. The main focus of the valuation model is the quantoed total return on the FX rate.

There must exist a measure under which all the tradeables on the Canadian market, discounted by the Canadian saving account, including CU and CE, are martingales. A standard Brownian motion under this measure w* is coupled with the original Brownian motion:
