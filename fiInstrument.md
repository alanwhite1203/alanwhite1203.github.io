### Variable Rate Swap

Variable rate swap is a special type of interest rate swap in which one leg of the swap corresponds to fixed rate payments while the other involves fixed rate payments for an initial period of time and a floating rate for the rest. The floating rate on that portion is defined as a minimum of two index rates.

We treat the two index rates as assets whose values are lognormally distributed random variable. Their pricing procedure uses discount factors retrieved from the EURIBOR curve.
