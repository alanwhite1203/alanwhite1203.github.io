## Workflow Context and Definitions


   
Workflow Templates are designed within Jaguar and are defined by a set of Workflow States, Workflow Transitions, and associated Workflow Actions. Users interact with a particular Workflow Instance, and each Instance is created from a Workflow Template.

a.	Workflow Template Design. A workflow template can be designed, such that workflow states, transitions, actions, and rules can be created/updated/deleted.
