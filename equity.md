### Equity Asian Option 

An Asian option or average option is a special type of option contract  where the payoff depends on the average price of the underlying asset over a certain period of 
time. The payoff is different from the case of a European option or American option, where the payoff of the option contract depends on the price of the underlying 
stock at exercise date. 

Asian options allow the buyer to purchase or sell the underlying asset at the average price instead of the spot price. Asian options are commonly seen options over 
the OTC markets. Average price options are less expensive than regular options and are arguably more appropriate than regular options for meeting some of the needs 
of corporate treasurers. Average can be calculated in a number of ways (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.). This presentation provides an overview of Asian equity option 
product and valuation.

### Equity Basket Option
 
A Basket Option is an option whose payoff depends on the value of a portfolio or basket of assets. The assets in an equity basket option could be equity indices or individual equities. A basket option can be used to hedge the risk exposure to or speculate the market move on the underlying stock basket. 

A basket option can be used to hedge the risk exposure to or speculate the market move on the underlying stock basket. Because it involves just one transaction, a basket option often costs less than multiple single options. The most important feature of a basket option is its ability to efficiently hedge risk on multiple assets at the same time. Rather than hedging each individual asset, the investor can manage risk for the basket, or portfolio, in one transaction. The benefits of a single transaction can be great, especially when avoiding the costs associated with hedging each and every component of the basket or portfolio.

### Convertible Bond
  
Convertible bonds can be thought of as normal corporate bonds with embedded options, which enable the holder to exchange the bond asset for the issuer's stock. Having properties of both stocks and bonds, convertibles can be an attractive choice for investors and have tended to have lower risk. 

A convertible bond has an embedded call option that gives bondholders the right to convert their bonds into equity at a given time for a predetermined number of shares in the issuing company. Whereas a reverse convertible bond has an embedded put option that gives the issuer the right to convert the bond's principal into shares of equity at a set date.

### Equity Futures
   
An Equity Forward contract is an agreement between two counterparties to buy a specific number of equity stocks, stock index or basket at a given price (called strike price) at a given date. For any forward contract no cash changes hands until the maturity of the contract. Equity forward contracts are cash settled in most cases. At maturity, the two counterparties exchange a cashflow equivalent to the difference between the stock closing price and the strike price. Equity forward contract is traded over the counter (OTC) instead of exchange market. 

Differently from Equity Forward, an Equity Futures contract traded over the organized exchange. In this contract parties commit to buy or sell a specified amount of an individual equity or a basket of equities or an equity index at an agreed contract price on a specified date. Generally there are two types of Equity Futures: Index Future and Stock Future. Stock markets Index Futures are futures contracts used to replicate the performance of an underlying stock market index. They can be used for hedging against an existing equity position, or speculating on future movements of the index. Indices for futures include well-established indices such as S&P 500, FTSE 100, DAX, CAC 40 and other G12 country indices. Indices for OTC products are broadly similar, but offer more flexibility.

### Equity Option
   
Equity options, which are the most common type of equity derivatives, give an investor the right but not the obligation to buy a call or sell a put at a set strike price prior to the contract’s expiry date. Equity options are derivatives that means their value is derived from the value of an underlying equity. Investors and traders can use equity options to take a long or short position in a stock without actually buying or shorting the stock. This is advantageous because taking a position with options allows the investor/trader more leverage in that the amount of capital needed is much less than a similar outright long or short position on margin. Investors/traders can therefore profit more from a price movement in the underlying stock.

Equity options or stock options provide investors a way to hedge risk or speculate.  Also option trading can limit an investor’s risk and leverage investing potential. Option investors have a number of strategies they can utilize, depending on risk tolerance and expected return.

### Equity Swap
   
An equity swap is an OTC contract between two parties to exchange a set of cash flows in the future. Normally one party pays the return based on capital gains and dividends realized on an equity security and the other party pays the return based on a floating interest rate plus a spread. 

An equity swap can be used to transfer both the credit risk and the market risk of an underlying asset. Equity swaps can be also used to avoid transaction costs (including Tax), to avoid locally based dividend taxes, limitations on leverage (notably the US margin regime) or to get around rules governing the particular type of investment that an institution can hold. Equity swaps can make investment barriers vanish and help an investor create leverage.

### Warrant
   
An equity warrant is an option on the equity of a firm issued by the same firm, which gives the holder the right to purchase shares at a fixed price from the firm at a future date. When a warrant is exercised, the firm typically issues new shares at the exercise price to fill the order. The resulting increase in shares outstanding dilutes the share value. 

An equity warrant gives the holder the right to purchase shares at a fixed price from the firm. It is an option on the common stock of a firm issued by the same firm. Warrants are in many ways similar to call options, but a few key differences distinguish them.

### Variance Swap

The market value of a variance swap is based on the variance determined from
a combination of realized (historical) volatility and unrealized volatility obtained from broker's quote.

### Lookback Option

A lookback option gives the option holder the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at the lowest price. It pays a single call-option-style payoff based on the performance of the underlying asset’s final price relative to its initial price, where both the initial and final prices are computed using a lookback formula.

The initial price is taken as the highest price observed over a set of Initial Lookback Dates. The final price is taken as the maximum of the running cumulative average, observed over a set of Payoff Observation Dates.
