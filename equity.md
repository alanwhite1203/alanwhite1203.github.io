 ### Equity Basket Option
 
 A basket option can be used to hedge the risk exposure to or speculate the market move on the underlying stock basket. Because it involves just one transaction, 
 a basket option often costs less than multiple single options. The most important feature of a basket option is its ability to efficiently hedge risk on multiple 
 assets at the same time. Rather than hedging each individual asset, the investor can manage risk for the basket, or portfolio, in one transaction. The benefits 
 of a single transaction can be great, especially when avoiding the costs associated with hedging each and every component of the basket or portfolio.

  into shares of equity at a set date.

   ### Equity Futures
   
   An Equity Forward contract is an agreement between two counterparties to buy a specific number of equity stocks, stock index or basket at a given price 
   (called strike price) at a given date. For any forward contract no cash changes hands until the maturity of the contract. Equity forward contracts are cash 
   settled in most cases. At maturity, the two counterparties exchange a cashflow equivalent to the difference between the stock closing price and the strike price.
   Equity forward contract is traded over the counter (OTC) instead of exchange market.

   An equity swap can be used to transfer both the credit risk and the market risk of an underlying asset. Equity swaps can be also used to avoid transaction 
   costs (including Tax), to avoid locally based dividend taxes, limitations on leverage (notably the US margin regime) or to get around rules governing the 
   particular type of investment that an institution can hold. Equity swaps can make investment barriers vanish and help an investor create leverage.
