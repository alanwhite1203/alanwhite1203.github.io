## Violation Use Case
 
Violations disappear by the time they may get to the PM to approve.  Keep a picture of what happened when the trade occurred so that the PM can understand what is going on. What would be beneficial is a chart 
(adaptive tries to do this but fails) where you can select the range you want to see and a nice picture that shows the line and usage, then you can drill in to any given day and see more info.

A Violation Group that has some “not legitimate” Violations and some “legitimate” violations. Options for handling this include:
-	Split the workflow every time a “not legitimate” violation is identified.
-	Denote a violation as “not legitimate”, however allow it to remain in a Violation Group. Any designation of legitimate must be confirmed by Market Risk.

For Breach severities we can reduce the list of options to two.  Primary and Secondary.  CCR will only use Primary.  The difference between the two will be the workflow process that is launched as a result of 
breaching a limit.  Primary will include an option for escalation of the breach / violation as a potential IPA, whereas a secondary will not.
