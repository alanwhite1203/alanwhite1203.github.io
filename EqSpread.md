## Spread Option Valuation
   
A spread option is an option whose payoff depends on the difference of two underling assets: S2(T) and S1(T). The buyer of a spread option has the right to 
be paid, at the maturity date T, the difference S2(T)âˆ’S1(T), known as the spread. To exercise the option, the buyer must pay at maturity a prespecified price K, known as the strike, or the exercise price of the option.

The use of spread options is widespread for hedge, speculation, and basis risk mitigation. Spread options allow investors to simultaneously take positions in two assets and profit from their price 
difference.

Spread options are mainly traded in equity, currency, and fixed income markets.
